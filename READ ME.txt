This program must be run with sudo, this ensures that the file is locked to 
typical users without root privileges. If populating a file from scratch, 
the program will check if a file exists, if it doesn't then it will create it. 
Furthermore, the program will check to see if the file is empty, if so, it 
will directly take the prompt to the admin role to fill in at least one user.  
Also the program will display "Press Enter To Continue." and wait for the user 
to push enter after every input that requires an integer input. This is by
design to clear the buffer of any data that may affect the logical flow of the 
program.
